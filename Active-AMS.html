          <h1>Active Acumulator Managment System</h1>
          <p>As a member of the University of Waterloo Formula Electric Design team I was tasked with designing an active
             cell balancing board for our accumulator. At the time I joined the team our existing AMS board was
              responsible for monitoring the temperature of the cylindrical LiPo cells within the accumulator as well 
              as the voltages of all cells. The existing board employed passive cell balancing which discharged a cell 
              that was charging at a rate faster than the surrounding cells through a MOSFET and high-power resistor. 
              The existing design was based on the LTC6804 chip.</p>

            <p>The existing board was only used during the charging phase to balance cells, while the cells were 
                discharging there was no way to redistribute charge throughout the cells if one cell was charging 
                faster than the others.</p>

            <p>The active accumulator management board I designed used synchronous flyback transformers to transfer
               charge between individual group of parallel cells and the rest of the battery stack. The LTC3300 chip
                was used for this design as it supported ISO SPI communication that had already been implemented with
                 the previous boards. The board was designed in Altium designer.</p>

            <p>The AMS boards must fit inside the accumulator box; however, the team did not want to rebuild the
               accumulator box to accommodate a larger AMS board, therefore the active AMS board was required to have
                the same board space as the passive balancing board. This required a clever Power trace layout.</p>

            <p>This project was canceled 70% of the way through the design phase when the formula electric electrical
               team lead realised the internal resistances of the LiPo cell composing our accumulator were
                sufficiently well controlled that active cell balancing was not worth the development time and cost.</p>
