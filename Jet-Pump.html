            <h1>Slurry Jet Pump</h1>
            <p>Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo dose not cover fluid mechanics, 
              nevertheless I am responsible for designing the muck excavation system for the tunnel boring machine (TBM). I have
            taught myself all the necessary fluid mechanics concepts to complete this project.</p>
            
            <p>Our TBM is digging in clay soil with no reported large rocks, as a result our TBM 
            is designed to pass solids with a maximum diameter of 2in. We are using a Jet pump and slurry 
            line for muck excavation due to the small scale of our design and the mechanical simplicity of 
            a jet pump. A typical jet pump injects high pressure water in the center of a pipe to transfer the kinetic
            energy of a high velocity water jet to the slurry in which the jet is immersed. 
            In our case this design would require an unreasonably large jet pump to pass solids up to 2inch in diameter. 
            I settled on injecting the high-pressure water around the circumference of the slurry line so the pump 
            could pass 2inch diameter rocks through the center while keeping the outside dimensions to a minimum.</p>

            <p>I am modeling the clay mixed with water and a soil conditioning surfactant agent with the Hershel-Buckley model.
              I have preliminary values for Herchel-Buckley parameters, but I am scheduled to test a treated soil sample
              in the University of Waterloo's soils laboratory to experimentally determine the Hershel-Buckley parameters of our soil
              under the advisement of Professor Mark Knight.</p>

              <p>The geometry of the pump was modeled in SolidWorks. I am preforming the CFD simulation in Ansys Fluent.
                 The CFD simulation is not a straightforward process as there are no accurate CFD models for turbulent flow
                  of non-Newtonian fluids other than direct numerical simulation (Which is too computationally expensive to be practical). 
                  As of August 15th, 2024 I am currently investigating how to simulate the performance of the pump before 
                  manufacturing.</p>

            <p>Due to the required manufacturing tolerances, durability requirements and geometry of the part we are 
              manufacturing it using selective laser sintered plastic (SLS) 3-D printing technology.</p>
