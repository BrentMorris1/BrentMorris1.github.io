          <h1>WatDig High Voltage</h1>
          <p>WatDig is the University of Waterlooâ€™s student design team competing in the Not-a-Boring Competition. 
            It is our first year compeating in the full scale competition building a tunnel boring machine (TBM) meaning everything is designed from scratch. 
            I am responsible for the design and construction of the high voltage power system. Our team is on track to finsh construction by end of year.
          </p>

          <p>The high voltage distribtion is straightforward as ilustrated in the single line diagram. All circuits are appropriatley fused and are equiped with disconnecting means.
            The motors are controlled by the ACS550 VFDs. The branch circuits are protected from ground fault in accordance with the UL943C standard.
            This protection is acompished with Bender ground impeadance monitors and a Bender ground fault current monitor.
            The incoming power is metered and the Bender relays interface with the contorls system.

          <p>The electrical team is currentley constructing and testing the high voltage distrubtion. Please reach out for progress as
            we are progressing rapidly.
