            <h1>Slurry Jet Pump</h1>
            <p> Though fluid mechanics is not part of the Electrical Engineering curriculum at the University of Waterloo,
             I am responsible for designing the muck excavation system for WatDig's tunnel boring machine (TBM). I have
            taught myself all the necessary fluid mechanics concepts to complete this project.</p>
            
            <p>Our TBM is designed to pass solids with a maximum diameter of 2in since it will be digging in clay soil 
              with no reported large rocks. We are using a jet pump and slurry line for muck excavation due to the small 
              scale of our TBM and the mechanical simplicity of a jet pump. A typical jet pump injects high pressure 
              water in the center of a pipe to transfer the kinetic energy of a high velocity water jet to the slurry 
              in which the jet is immersed. 
            In our case this design would require an unreasonably large jet pump to pass solids up to 2in in diameter. 
            I settled on injecting the high-pressure water around the circumference of the slurry line so the pump 
            could pass 2in diameter rocks through the center while keeping the outside dimensions to a minimum.</p>

            <p>I am modelling the clay mixed with water and a soil conditioning surfactant agent with the Herschel-Bulkley model.
              Though I have preliminary values for Herschel-Bulkley parameters, I am scheduled to test a treated soil sample
              in the University of Waterloo's soils laboratory, under the advisement of Professor Mark Knight, to experimentally 
              determine the Herschel-Bulkley parameters of our slurry.</p>

              <p>The geometry of the pump was modelled in SolidWorks. I am performing the CFD simulation in Ansys Fluent.
                 The CFD simulation is not a straightforward process as there are no accurate CFD models for turbulent flow
                  of non-Newtonian fluids other than direct numerical simulation (which is too computationally expensive to be practical). 
                  As of August 15th, 2024 I am currently investigating how to simulate the performance of the pump before 
                  manufacturing.</p>

            <p>We are manufacturing the pump using selective laser-sintered plastic (SLS) 3-D printing technology due to the pumpâ€™s
               required manufacturing tolerances, durability and geometry.</p>
