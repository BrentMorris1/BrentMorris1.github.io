            <p>I designed the jet pump for the TBM to transport mined slurry from the bellow ground cutting face to surface level.
               After self-studying fluid mechanics, I simulated the behavior of dozens of designs in Ansys Fluent. Ultimately, 
               I concluded the results of the simulation were highly dependent on the density, the effective viscosity of the slurry 
               and the pump curve of the water supply pump. I manufactured four different jet pumps with different nozzle cross sections 
               for physical testing based on the most promising results from CFD analysis. Physical testing is currently underway. </p>

              <p>I am involved in the mechanical design of many components of the TBM, especialy the hydralic system. Please feel free to
                reach out for more details about our mechanical design. We are progressing rapidly.
              </p>
