          <h1>WatDig</h1>
          <p>WatDig is the University of Waterlooâ€™s student design team competing in the Not a Boring Competition.
             The team was founded in Fall 2023 and competed in the navigation mini competition in Bastrop, Texas in
              March 2024. After winning the navigation award the team decided to pursue the full-scale competition
               and design a full-scale tunnel boring machine (TBM) to dig a 50cm diameter tunnel 30m in length. I officialy joined
               the WatDig team in May 2024 at the very begining of the design of the full-scale TBM, however I helped resolve
               a few electrical issues for the team from January to March 2024. </p>

          <p>I joined the team for my electrical knowledge; however, the detail of my initial electrical design was 
            severely limited when I joined as the team was starting from scratch and did not know their electrical loads. 
            My role on the team is currently extremely multidisciplinary as I am involved with the design of the majority 
            of the components in the design. I want to help the team make a functioning TBM, regardless of what work that 
            requires. Some of the odds and ends work I have contributed to includes</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Proposition and research of an Auger cutterface design as opposed to scrapers </li>
            <li>Proposition and research of a winch-based tunnel jacking system, as opposed to hydraulic jacks</li>
            <li>Calculation of thrusting forces required to advance tunnel lining segments and TBM</li>
            <li>Development of project management procedure and project schedule for all subteams in Office Libre (freeware clone of Microsoft Project).</li>
            <li>Consultation in the design of the hydraulic system for pipe jacking system</li>
            <li>Electrical controls architecture</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please feel free to ask me anything about our TBM design.</p>
