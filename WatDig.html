          <h1>WatDig</h1>
          <p>WatDig is the University of Waterlooâ€™s student design team competing in the Not-a-Boring Competition.
             The team was founded in Fall 2023 and competed in the navigation mini competition in Bastrop, Texas in
              March 2024. After winning the navigation award with the Hermes I rover, the team decided to pursue the full-scale competition
               and design a tunnel boring machine (TBM) to dig a 50cm diameter tunnel 30m in length. Though I formally joined
               the WatDig team in May 2024 at the beginning of the design of the full-scale TBM, I helped resolve
               electrical issues for the Hermes I rover from January to March 2024. </p>

          <p>While I am officially responsible for the electrical design of the TBM, the mechanical design must come first.
            My role on the team is currently extremely multidisciplinary as I am involved in the design of the majority 
            of the components of the TBM. I want to help the team make a functioning TBM, regardless of what work is  
            required. The work I have contributed to includes</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Researching and proposing an auger cutter face design as opposed to a scraper cutter face design </li>
            <li>Researching and proposing a winch-based tunnel lining jacking system, as opposed to hydraulic jacks</li>
            <li>Calculating thrusting forces required to advance tunnel lining segments and the TBM</li>
            <li>Designing 480VAC motor control system</li>
            <li>Developing a project management procedure and project schedule for all subteams in Project Libre (freeware clone of Microsoft Project)</li>
            <li>Consulting in the design of the hydraulic system for the pipe jacking system</li>
            <li>Electrical controls architecture</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Please feel free to ask me anything about WatDig's design.</p>
