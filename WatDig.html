            <h1>WatDig</h1>
            <p>WatDig is the University of Waterlooâ€™s student design team competing in the not a boring competition.
               The team was founded in fall 2023 and competed in the navigation mini competition in Bastrop, Texas in
                March 2024. After winning the navigation award the team decided to pursue the full-scale competition
                 and design a full-scale tunnel boring machine to dig a 50cm diameter tunnel 30m in length. I have
                  been with the team since the beginning of the full-scale machine design May 2024. </p>

            <p>I joined the team for my electrical knowledge; however, the detail of my initial electrical design was 
              severely limited due to the fact the team did not know their mechanical requirements at the time. 
              My role on the team is currently extremely multidisciplinary as I am involved with the design of the majority 
              of the components in the design. I want to help the team make a functioning TBM, regardless of what work that 
              requires. Some of the odds and ends work I have contributed to includes</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Proposition and research of an Auger cutterface design as opposed to scrapers </li>
              <li>Proposition and research of a winch-based tunnel jacking system, as opposed to hydraulic jacks</li>
              <li>Calculation of thrusting forces required to advance tunnel lining segments and tunnel boring machine</li>
              <li>Development of project management procedure and project schedule for all subteams in Office libre.</li>
              <li>Consultation in the design of the hydraulic system for pipe jacking system</li>
              <li>Electrical controls architecture</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please feel free to ask me anything about our TBM design.</p>
